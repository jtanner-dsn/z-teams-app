# Z Teams App

### Todo
- figure out why .env vars aren't working
  - probably not working because react uses webpack under the hood
  - look at [the docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/)
  - try using [webpack-dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-webpack)
  - try [overriding](https://marmelab.com/blog/2021/07/22/cra-webpack-no-eject.html#:~:text=Create%2DReact%2DApp%20is%20a,unless%20you%20decide%20to%20eject%20.)?
- get project list
  - load into dropdown (check fuentUI for dropdown component)
- when project is selected, load risk data into dropdown
- create risk component that will be bound to the risk data
- when risk is chosen, load risk data on right side
- display super basic risk data and test that it works
- find fields, and other components in fluentUI
- display risk data using them

- try making the app transactional
